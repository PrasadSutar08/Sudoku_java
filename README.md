Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle played on a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 subgrids.
The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and subgrid contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
It requires logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and problem-solving skills.
Variations include different grid sizes and constraints.
